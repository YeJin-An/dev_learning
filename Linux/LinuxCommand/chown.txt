[Linux]파일 관리 - chown 파일/디렉토리 소유권 변경

Syntax:
chown [OPTION]... [OWNER] [:[GROUP]] FILE...
chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

Example: To change owner of the file:
chown owner_name file_name

Note: To view the permissions we use:
ls -l

Now of i use .../txt in my case,
to change ownership 
I will use the following syntax:
-> chown master file1.txt

where the master is another user in the system
여기의 mater는 다른 사용자이다 system에서

Assume that if you are user named user1 
and you want to change ownship to root.
use "sudo" before syntax.

Options:
-c : Reports when a file change is made.
Reports -> 보고하다
-v : it is used to show the verbose 
     information for every file processed.
verbose information : 장황한 정보 of 자세한 정보
every file : 모든파일
processed : 가공된 or 처리된.

이것은 사용된다 보여준다 자세한 정보를
처리된 모든 파일로 부터,

-f : it suppresses most of the error messages.
When you are not permitted to change group permissions and shows error,
this option forcefully/silently changes the ownership
chown :group1 file.txt
suppresses : 표시하다
permit : 허용하다
forcefully : 강제 
silently   : 자동 


Examples:

":" : You can see that the group permissions changed to group form root,
if you use -v option it will report that.
We just need add a ":" to change group.
-> chown master:group greek1
// 그룹 변경하기 위한 수단이나 도구 ":"

1> To Change group ownership  
  --> chown :group file.txt

2> To change the owner as well as group:
as well as : ~ 뿐만 아니라
  --> chown master:group1 greek1

3> To change the owner form particular ownership only
particular ownership only : 특정 소유권 만
Suppose we want to change ownership from master to root 
where current owner must be master only.
Suppose : 가정하다
master only : master 만
  --> chown --from-master root greek1
 ** -c , -v , -f , :??

 4> To change group from a particulat group:
 chown --from-:group1 root greek1
