Linux File Hierarchy Structure
Hierarachy : 위계질서

The Linux File Hierarchy Structure and 
directory contents in Inix-like operating systems
Hierarchy Structure : 계층구조
directory contents : directory 내용
Unix-like : Unix 계층

-> In the FHS, all files and directories appear 
under the root directory /,
even if they are stored on different physical or
virtual devices
directories : 전화번호부
they are stored : 그들은 저장된다.


-> Some of these directories only exist on a particular system
if certain subsystems, such as the X Window system
are installed
exist : 존재한다.
particular : 특별한,특정한
certain : 확실한
subsystems : 하위 시스템
sush as : ~ 같은


Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems
and are generally used in much the same way;
are generally : 일반적으로 
much : 무엇의 양을 물어볼때,

however, the descriptions here are
those used specifically for the FHS and not considered
authoritative for platforms other than Linux.
description : 설명
specifically : 구체적으로
considered : 고래하다
authoritative : 권의적인 권의있는 


1. /(Root) : Primary hierarchy root and 
        root directory of the entire file system hierarchy

>Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
>The only root user has the right to write under this directory
the right : 권한이 있습니다.
>/root is the root user's home directory, which is not the same as /


2. /bin : Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-
          user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp
essential : 필수적인
command : 명령
binaries : 바이너리
available : 이용할 수 있는
single-user mode : 단일 사용자 모드

> Contains binary executables 
> Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes
  are located under this directory.
> Commands used by all the users of the system
  are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp
binary : 2진법의
common linux commands : 일반 리눅스 명령
here : 시점, 순간, 여기

3. ./boot : Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.
initrd : 제1의

> Kernel inited, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
-> 이 3가지 파일은 /boot 아래에 위치되어 있습니다.
> Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic
-> 예를 들면 이렇게 됩니다.


4. /dev:Essential device files,ge.g., /dev/null.

> These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system
> Example : /dev/tty1 , /dev/usbmon0
attached : 첨부되다


5. ./etc
6. ./home

9. ./mnt
10. ./opt
11. ./sbin
12/ ./srv
13. ./tmp
14. ./usr
15. ./proc
